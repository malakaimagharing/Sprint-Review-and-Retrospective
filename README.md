# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
To interpret user needs, I focus on understanding the goals and pain points of the end users. Creating user stories is essential because it frames the requirements from the user’s perspective, breaking down large needs into manageable, actionable tasks. User stories prioritize value for the customer and keep development work focused and purposeful.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development by breaking the work into small, iterative tasks. Rather than trying to build an entire system at once, I focus on developing usable parts that can be tested and improved incrementally. In my future work, I hope to incorporate Agile processes like regular sprint planning, daily standups (even if informal), backlog grooming, and sprint retrospectives. These practices will help keep projects adaptable and user-centered.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, being accountable for your work, and staying open to feedback. It involves actively collaborating with others, helping remove obstacles, and focusing on the team’s shared goals rather than individual success. A strong team member supports continuous improvement, both personally and within the team.
